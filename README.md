<h2>Overview</h2>
Openbaton Client provides a command-line client, which enables you to access the project API through easy-to-use commands. 
For example, Openbaton Client provides the creation of a new Vim instance.
You can run the commands from the command line with the relative json that describe the Vim instance. 
Openbaton APIs are RESTful APIs, and use the HTTP protocol. They include methods, URIs, media types, and response codes.
Openbaton APIs are open-source Java clients, and can run on Linux or Mac OS X systems.
